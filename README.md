This R markdown file written in the R programming language can be used to reproduceÂ all results in the manuscript "Isolation by distance promotes strain diversification in the wild mouse gut microbiota". 

The code has been tested in R v4.5.0. The install time of required libraries is typically less than 1 hour on a standard desktop computer. 

To run the analysis:
1) unzip `strain_diversification_input.tar.gz` in the working directory with `tar -xzvf strain_diversification_input.tar.gz`.
2) Open `MAG_instrain_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio (or another interactive IDE).
3) Run all code chunks in order. 

Expected outputs are described in the R script. The expected runtime for the demo on a standard desktop computer is < 4 hours. 

The following R libraries are required:
geosphere
ape
vegan
MKinfer
ecodist
phytools
tidyverse
nlme
permuco
